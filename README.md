[**Uberduck**](https://uberduck.ai/) is a tool for fun and creativity with neural text-to-speech. This repository will get you creating your own speech synthesis models. Please see our [**training**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jF-Otw2_ssEcus4ISaIZu3QDmtifUvyY) and [**synthesis**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wXWuhnw2pdfFy1L-pUzHfopW10W2GiJS) notebooks.

## Overview

The models in this repository used in production are the Tacotron2, SO-VITS-SVC, zero-shot RADTTS, and HiFi-GAN.  Training code is included for Tacotron2, RADTTS, and HiFi-GAN.  Other goodies include fill-populating inference, additional languages, and Torchmoji emotional encoding.  Please reach out for help or to contribute!
